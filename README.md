# rtsha1
A Decompilation of Geometry Dash's Sha1 functions

## Why put this here?
I put this module into a seperate repository because unlike the other modules that geometry dash uses this one requires absolutely nothing to put together (no external libraries required) making it very easy for us to brute-force for the correct assembly configurations. My goal when we finally and completely reverse engineer this module is to benchmark Robtop's sha1 implementation with other code such as python's hashlib and many more libraries and see how it compares to other sha1 implementations since it's very different from any of the others that I've seen, hecne why I wanted to look into it reverse it fully and then benchmark it.
